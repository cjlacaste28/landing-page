# Cloning a responsive website using HTML and CSS only.

This project is developed as part of my coding bootcamp at Kodigo Code Camp . We are supposed to clone a landing page website and make it responsive using only HTML and CSS. No framework was implemented like Bootstrap, pure HTML and CSS only.
